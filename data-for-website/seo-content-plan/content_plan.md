## Internal Linking Strategy

### Hub-to-Spoke Model

## On-Page SEO Requirements

### Title Tag Format
```
[Primary Keyword]: [Value Prop/Hook] | [Brand Name]
```
Examples:

### Meta Description Format
```
[Direct answer/offering]. [Proof point]. [CTA].
```
Example:

### Header Structure (H1-H3)
```
H1: [Primary Keyword - Value Prop]
  H2: [Service/Feature]
    H3: [Detail/Sub-point]
  H2: [Service/Feature]
    H3: [Detail/Sub-point]
  H2: FAQ
    H3: [Question 1]
    H3: [Question 2]

## Duplicate Content Prevention

### Canonical Strategy
- Each page has self-referencing canonical
- Sub-pages with potential consolidation (clinic/dental) keep separate URLs
- Fort Worth page is separate entity (no canonical to Dallas)

### Content Differentiation
- Each service page has unique:
  - Service description specific to that industry
  - FAQ section with industry-specific questions
  - Customer testimonials (when available)
  - Pricing factors unique to that service

### Noindex Rules
- `/thank-you` pages (lead capture confirmations)
- Draft/unpublished content

## Schema Markup Strategy
