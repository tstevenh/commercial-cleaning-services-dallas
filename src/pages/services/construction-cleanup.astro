    question: 'What is included in post-construction cleaning?',
    answer: 'Post-construction cleaning removes construction dust, debris, and residues. Services include dusting all surfaces, cleaning fixtures, cleaning windows, floor care, debris removal, and preparing the space for occupancy. We address both rough and final cleaning phases.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between rough and final cleaning?',
    answer: 'Rough cleaning happens during or immediately after construction. It removes large debris, heavy dust, and construction materials.

  },
  {
    question: 'Do you remove construction debris?',
    answer: 'Yes. We remove construction debris including packaging, scrap materials, fasteners, and job-site waste. We coordinate with your general contractor to ensure proper disposal and leave your facility broom-clean and ready for use.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does post-construction cleaning take?',
    answer: 'Project duration depends on facility size and construction conditions. Small projects might take one day. Large facilities or complex projects may require several days. We provide timeline estimates during our assessment and can accelerate staffing if deadlines are tight.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you clean after specific types of construction?',
    answer: 'Yes. We clean after new construction, renovations, remodeling, and tenant finish-out. Different construction types generate different cleaning challenges, and we adjust our methods accordingly.'

  {
    question: 'Do you clean new construction and renovations?',
    answer: 'Yes. For new construction, we address all construction-related soil and prepare the facility for first occupancy. For renovations and remodels, we clean areas affected by construction and also address adjacent areas that collected dust or debris.'

  <p>
    <strong>Post-construction cleaning in Dallas</strong> prepares newly built or renovated facilities for occupancy. Construction and renovation projects leave behind dust, debris, and residues that standard cleaning cannot address. Our construction cleanup services handle everything from fine dust removal to debris disposal, delivering facilities ready for handoff.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're a general contractor completing a new build, a property manager preparing a space for tenants, or a business owner finishing renovations, our construction cleanup services provide the thorough cleaning needed to transition from construction to occupancy. We understand construction schedules, deadlines, and the importance of delivering clean facilities on time.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Post-Construction Cleaning Process</h2>

  <p>
    Construction cleanup typically occurs in phases. We work with your project schedule to provide cleaning at the appropriate times.
  </p>

  <h3>Rough Cleaning Phase</h3>
  <p>
    Rough cleaning removes large construction debris and heavy dust accumulation. This phase may happen during construction or immediately after major work completes. We remove scrap materials, packaging, fasteners, and substantial debris. This phase prepares the space for final trades and finishing work.
  </p>

  <h3>Final Cleaning Phase</h3>
  <p>
    Final cleaning happens after all construction and installation work is complete. This is the detailed cleaning that prepares your facility for handoff. We address fine dust on all surfaces, clean fixtures and finishes, polish floors and finishes, and ensure every space meets move-in standards.
  </p>

  <h2>Construction Debris Removal</h2>

  <p>
    Beyond cleaning, construction projects generate debris that requires removal and disposal. We handle this aspect of post-construction cleanup.
  </p>

  <h3>Construction Waste Removal</h3>
  <p>
    We remove construction waste including packaging, scrap materials, cutoffs, excess materials, and general job-site debris. We sort materials appropriately and coordinate disposal according to your requirements and local regulations.
  </p>

  <h3>Protective Material Removal</h3>
  <p>
    During construction, floors, fixtures, and surfaces are often protected with paper, plastic, or tape. We remove these protective materials systematically, taking care not to damage the finished surfaces underneath.
  </p>

  <h3>Site Sweeping and Preparation</h3>
  <p>
    Exterior areas and job sites collect debris during construction. We sweep and clean these areas, removing nails, screws, scrap materials, and hazards. This leaves the site clean and safe for final inspection and handoff.
  </p>

  <h2>Detailed Surface Cleaning After Construction</h2>

  <p>
    Construction dust settles on every surface. Final cleaning addresses this dust comprehensively.
  </p>

  <h3>Floor Cleaning and Finishing</h3>
  <p>
    New floors require thorough cleaning before handoff. We clean VCT tile, concrete, hardwood, and other flooring types appropriately. This may involve sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, or applying finish as specified. We address both installation residues and general construction dust.
  </p>

  <h3>Fixture and Finish Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Installed fixtures including lighting, plumbing fixtures, cabinetry, hardware, and trim require detailed cleaning to remove construction dust and fingerprints. We clean all these surfaces carefully, avoiding damage to new finishes.
  </p>

  <h3>Window and Glass Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Windows accumulate construction dust and residue from materials like drywall compound. We clean all glass including windows, mirrors, glass partitions, and architectural glass features. This includes both interior and exterior accessible glass.
  </p>

  <h3>Dusting and Vertical Surface Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Construction dust coats walls, ceilings, and vertical surfaces. We dust and clean all these surfaces, removing the fine layer of construction residue. This includes detailed work around fixtures, trim, and architectural features.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Construction Projects We Clean</h2>

  <p>
    We provide post-construction cleaning for various project types throughout Dallas.
  </p>

  <h3>New Construction Cleanup</h3>
  <p>
    New buildings require complete cleaning from construction debris removal to final cleaning. We address all spaces including offices, restrooms, break rooms, lobbies, and mechanical areas. We deliver facilities ready for furniture installation, move-in, or operation.
  </p>

  <h3>Renovation and Remodel Cleanup</h3>
  <p>
    Remodeling projects affect both renovated areas and adjacent spaces that collected dust. We clean renovated areas to address construction residues and also clean surrounding areas to remove dust that spread during work.
  </p>

  <h3>Tenant Finish-Out Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Tenant finish-out projects create construction dust and debris even in relatively small spaces. We clean these unit build-outs, preparing spaces for tenant improvements and move-in.
  </p>
