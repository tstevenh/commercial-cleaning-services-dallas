  <p>
    Government facilities in Dallas serve the public and require cleaning that meets both functional standards and public expectations. <strong>Government building cleaning</strong> addresses municipal offices, county facilities, and state buildings while working within security protocols, access restrictions, and budget requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike private commercial facilities, government buildings serve the public directly. Entrances, lobbies, waiting areas, and counters must present professionally while offices, meeting rooms, and restrooms require thorough maintenance. Our services address these needs while coordinating with facility management and security requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>Public Area and Lobby Cleaning</h2>

  </p>

  <h3>Building Access Procedures</h3>
  <p>
    We follow all building access requirements including sign-in procedures, badge protocols, and security screening. Our staff is trained in government facility security procedures and complies with all requirements.
  </p>

  <h3>Secure Area Cleaning</h3>
