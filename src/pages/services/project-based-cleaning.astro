  {
    question: 'What is project-based cleaning?',
    answer: 'Project-based cleaning refers to one-time or periodic deep cleaning services rather than recurring daily maintenance. Examples include post-construction cleaning, move-in/move-out cleaning, event cleaning, seasonal deep cleaning, or restoration cleaning for facilities that have gone without regular service.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does project-based cleaning differ from regular janitorial service?',
    answer: 'Regular janitorial service handles daily maintenance tasks on a recurring schedule. Project-based cleaning addresses larger, less frequent needs: deep cleaning after construction, prepping a facility for occupancy, cleaning after a major event, or restoring a neglected facility.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can you schedule project-based cleaning?',
    answer: 'We can often schedule project-based cleaning within days of your request depending on our schedule and project scope. Urgent projects such as post-construction cleanup or emergency situations can sometimes be addressed within 24 hours.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide free estimates for project-based cleaning?',
    answer: 'Yes. We assess your facility, discuss the project scope, and provide a written estimate. Site visits allow us to see the space and understand the work required, which ensures accurate pricing rather than rough estimates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of facilities need project-based cleaning?',
    answer: 'We serve various facility types including offices, retail spaces, warehouses, medical facilities, schools, restaurants, and industrial properties. Each project type has different requirements that we address in our planning.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does project-based cleaning typically take?',
    answer: 'Project duration varies based on facility size and scope. Small offices might take 4-8 hours. Large facilities or complex projects like post-construction cleanup may require several days. We provide timeline estimates as part of our proposal.'

  <p>
    Not every Dallas business needs daily cleaning. Some facilities require thorough, one-time cleaning to address specific situations: preparing a space for occupancy, cleaning after construction, addressing neglected maintenance, or handling post-event cleanup. Our <strong>project-based cleaning services</strong> provide deep cleaning without recurring commitments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Project-based cleaning requires more intensive labor and time than daily maintenance. We bring additional staff and equipment to complete your facility efficiently. Whether you need move-out cleaning, post-construction cleanup, or restoration cleaning for a neglected facility, we provide thorough one-time cleaning services.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Project-Based Cleaning Services</h2>

  <p>
    We provide various one-time cleaning services for Dallas businesses. Each project type has specific requirements that we address in planning and execution.
  </p>

  <h3>Move-In and Move-Out Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Facilities in transition require thorough cleaning. For move-in cleaning, we prepare spaces for new occupants by cleaning all surfaces, floors, fixtures, and areas that accumulated dust during vacancy. Move-out cleaning ensures facilities are clean for handoff to the next occupant or property owner.
  </p>

  <h3>Seasonal Deep Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Many Dallas businesses schedule annual or periodic deep cleaning projects. This addresses accumulated soil that daily cleaning cannot remove: floor wax buildup, carpet deep cleaning, detailed dusting, window washing, and thorough facility cleaning.
  </p>

  <h3>Neglected Facility Restoration Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Facilities that have gone without regular cleaning require restoration-level cleaning. We assess the situation, determine the scope of work, and provide deep cleaning that restores the facility to appropriate standards. This may require multiple visits and extensive labor.
  </p>

  <h3>Event and Function Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Special events generate unique cleaning needs. We provide pre-event preparation cleaning and post-event cleanup. Services address floor care, restroom cleaning, trash removal, and resetting spaces to their normal configuration.
  </p>

  <h2>Post-Construction Cleanup Services</h2>

  <p>
    Construction and renovation leave behind dust, debris, and residues that require specialized cleaning. Our <a href="/services/construction-cleanup">post-construction cleanup</a> prepares your facility for occupancy.
  </p>

  <h3>Rough and Final Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Construction projects often require multiple cleaning phases. Rough cleaning removes large debris and prepares surfaces for final work. Final cleaning happens after all construction is complete, addressing fine dust, cleaning fixtures, and preparing the space for handoff.
  </p>

  <h3>Construction Debris Removal</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond cleaning, we remove construction debris including packaging, scrap materials, and job-site waste. We coordinate with your general contractor to ensure proper disposal and leave the facility broom-clean.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Planning and Estimation</h2>

  <p>
    Every project-based cleaning job begins with thorough assessment and planning. We provide detailed proposals so you know exactly what to expect.
  </p>

  <h3>Site Assessment</h3>
  <p>
    We visit your facility to assess the scope of work. This includes measuring square footage, identifying surface types, noting heavily soiled areas, and understanding any access constraints or scheduling requirements.
  </p>

  <h3>Scope of Work Development</h3>
  <p>
    Based on our assessment, we develop a detailed scope of work. This includes specific tasks, equipment needed, staffing requirements, estimated time requirements, and pricing.
  </p>

  <h3>Scheduling and Coordination</h3>
  <p>
    We coordinate project scheduling to minimize disruption. For move-out cleaning, we work around your timeline. For construction projects, we coordinate with contractors. We accommodate your schedule constraints whenever possible.
  </p>

  <h2>What Makes Project-Based Cleaning Different</h2>

  <p>
    Project-based cleaning differs from daily maintenance in scope, intensity, and approach.
  </p>

  <h3>Deep Cleaning Focus</h3>
  <p>
    Rather than maintaining baseline cleanliness, project-based cleaning restores facilities from neglected or post-construction conditions. This requires more time, more intensive methods, and more thorough attention to detail.
  </p>

  <h3>Temporary Staffing Increase</h3>
  <p>
    Projects often require more staff than daily cleaning. We bring additional team members to complete work efficiently. This reduces project duration and gets your facility ready faster.
  </p>

  <h3>Specialized Equipment</h3>
  <p>
    Projects may require equipment not used in daily cleaning: floor machines, extractors, high-access equipment, or specialized tools. We bring appropriate equipment based on your facility requirements.
  </p>
