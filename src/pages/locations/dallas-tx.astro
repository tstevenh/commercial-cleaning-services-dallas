  <p>
    Dallas commercial facilities face specific environmental factors that affect cleaning requirements.
  </p>

  <h3>Humidity and Climate</h3>
  <p>
    Dallas humidity and climate affect facility maintenance. Moisture can contribute to mold, mildew, and floor issues. Our cleaning addresses these factors through proper ventilation, moisture control during cleaning, and attention to areas prone to humidity problems.

  <h3>Allergen and Dust Control</h3>
  <p>
    Dallas facilities accumulate dust and allergens that affect air quality. We use HEPA filtration vacuums and dust suppression methods to capture particulates rather than redistributing them. Regular dusting and vacuuming support healthier indoor environments.
  </p>

  <h3>High-Traffic Entryway Cleaning</h3>
  <p>
    Dallas commercial facilities see significant foot traffic through entryways. We focus on entrance cleaning including floors, doors, and vestibules to address tracked soil. Entry mats, floor cleaning, and surface care maintain first impressions and protect interior flooring.
